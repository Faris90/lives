# Youtube-Live-Subsciber-Count-Website

This Website gives the accurate subscriber count of a Youtube Channel in realtime which Youtube itself doesn't provide.

How to use:
1. Place the files into the server's public folder.
2. Now in the main.js add your CLIENT ID which you can get from Google APi's Console for free.
3. Now run the index.php from the server or localhost.
4. Now put the Channel ID in the textbox and the subscriber count will appear.
